    "# Comparison of Hacker News Posts\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to [reddit](https://reddit.com/). Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the original data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but for this project we have reduced the data set from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim in this project is to find out:\n",
    "* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    "* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by opening the datasets and exploring the data:"
